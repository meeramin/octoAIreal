title: "TypeScript SDK Installation & Setup"

#### Requirements:

* Node.js >= 18
* Generate a token using the [How to create an OctoAI API token](/docs/how-to-create-an-octoai-access-token) guide.
* Set the token to an environment variable named `OCTOAI_TOKEN` or pass it to the Client class on construction.

#### Installation:

The TypeScript SDK can be installed using NPM.

```bash bash
npm i @octoai/client
```

#### Setting API token as an environment variable:

In order to access endpoints from OctoAI, an API token needs to be set, for more information on how to generate an access token see [How to Create an OctoAI Access Token](/docs/how-to-create-an-octoai-access-token).

Wherever you set your environment variables for example in your `.bashrc` or `.env` file set `OCTOAI_TOKEN` to the value you generated following the guide.

```bash bash
export OCTOAI_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Alternatively, on creation of the [Client](https://octoml.github.io/octoai-typescript-sdk/classes/Client.html) class, you can set your token variable. Please see the [Client](https://octoml.github.io/octoai-typescript-sdk/classes/Client.html) docs for more information.
