## Environment setup

To run our example app, there are four simple steps to take:

1. Use a Llama2 demo model in your OctoAI account by visiting [https://octoai.cloud/tools/text/chat?model=llama-2-13b-chat-fp16&mode=api](https://octoai.cloud/tools/text/chat?model=llama-2-13b-chat-fp16&mode=api)
2. Paste the Endpoint URL in a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project.


```Bash Bash
ENDPOINT_URL="https://text.octoai.run/v1/chat/completions"
```

1. Get an API Token from [your OctoAI account page](https://octoai.cloud/settings).
2. Paste your API key in a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project.


```Bash Bash
OCTOAI_API_TOKEN=<your key here>
```

The next few pages will walk you through the detailed code in the repo.
