title: "Multi-user accounts"
description: "The default setup is 1 user profile per 1 OctoAI account. We can easily help you setup multiple users within a single account if you have a team or organization with multiple users. This will allow your team to manage endpoints, view logs & metrics, and securely share access to the account."
