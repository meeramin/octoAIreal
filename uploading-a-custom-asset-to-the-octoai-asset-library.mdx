title: "Uploading a custom asset to the OctoAI Asset Library"
description: "You can customize images using either OctoAI assets or custom assets from the OctoAI Asset Library"

OctoAI empowers you to customize images by leveraging assets like checkpoints, LoRAs, and textual inversions. You can either use:

* Public assets in the OctoAI Asset Library
* Upload your custom asset to the OctoAI Asset Library (private by default, and optionally public)
* Or use OctoAI fine-tuning to create new assets - see [Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion](/docs/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion)

This tutorial explains how to upload your own private assets to the Asset Library.

1. First download the OctoAI CLI by following the instructions in [CLI & SDK Installation](/docs/installation-links) Check that it is properly installed by running the following in your terminal:

```bash bash
$ octoai asset --help
Manage OctoAI assets

Usage:
  octoai asset [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create asset
  delete      Delete an asset
  get         Get asset
  list        List assets

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for asset

Global Flags:
      --log-level string   Set log level: fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")

Use "octoai asset [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

1. Run `octoai login` to cache your token and authenticate to your account.
2. We can now use the `octoai asset create` subcommand to upload assets (you can run `octoai asset create --help` to learn more on the options).  
   1. `--engine` denotes whether this is an asset for SDXL or SD1.5  
   2. `--upload-from-file` flag denotes the path of the file on your local machine that you’re trying to upload.  
   3. `--upload-from-url` flag is an alternative to `upload-from-file` allowing you to upload an asset from a public URL; OctoAI will fetch and upload the file.  
   4. `—type` can be lora, checkpoint, or textual\_inversion (VAEs coming soon)  
   5. `--format` denotes the format of your asset, which can be safetensors or pt.  
   6. `--datatype` can be fp16, fp32, int4, or int8\. For image gen, it should almost always be fp16, but for LLMs and other modalities your asset may have other datatypes.  
   7. `--name` is a name for your asset. You can only use each asset name once.  
   8. `--transfer-api` defaults to sts which is the fastest way to upload a large asset.  
   9. If you are uploading a textual inversion, make sure to use the `-w` flag to denote the default trigger word for the asset. That trigger word can later be used at generation time to activate the inversion. For LoRAs, trigger words are optional.

So for example, if you want to upload a Textual Inversion file from your local machine, you can call a command like:

```
octoai asset create \
  --upload-from-file negativeXL_D.safetensors \
  --name NegativeXL \
  --engine image/stable-diffusion-xl-v1-0 \
  --format safetensors \
  --data-type fp16 \
  --type textual_inversion \
  --description "NegativeXL Textual Inversion"
  -w "negativeXL_D"
  --public false
```

You can alternatively upload the file form a public URL using `upload-from-url`:

```
octoai asset create \
  --upload-from-url https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/negativeXL_D.safetensors \
  --name NegativeXL \
  --engine image/stable-diffusion-xl-v1-0 \
  --format safetensors \
  --data-type fp16 \
  --type textual_inversion \
  --description "NegativeXL Textual Inversion"
  -w "negativeXL_D"
  --public false
```

1. You can then use this Textual Inversion at image generation time while benefiting from OctoAI’s lightning fast asset load and e2e inference speed, for example with a payload to `[image.octoai.run/generate/{engine_id}](http://image.octoai.run/generate/{engine_id})` with the following in your payload  
Bash  
```
payload = {  
    ...  
    "textual_inversions": {  
        "NegativeXL": "negativeXL_D",  
    },  
}  
...  
```
