#### Pro pricing for Compute Service

1. Large 80: this maps to an A100 GPU with 80GB memory and is priced at $0.00145 per second (\~$5.20 per hour)
2. Large 40: this maps to an A100 GPU with 40GB memory and is priced at $0.00114 per second (\~$4.10 per hour)
3. Medium: this maps to an A10 GPU with 24GB memory and is priced at $0.00032 per second (\~$1.15 per hour)
4. Small: this maps to a T4 GPU with 16GB memory and is priced at $0.00011 per second (\~$0.40 per hour)

We bill by the second of **compute usage**, starting at the time when the endpoint is ready for inferences.

* In other words, we bill for the total of inference duration and timeout duration.
* We do NOT bill for the duration of cold start.
* The time when the endpoint is ready for inferences is when the healthcheck on your endpoint starts to return a 200; or in the case where your endpoint has no healthcheck, the time when you see the "Replica is running" log line in your Events tab in the UI.

Example models already have a pre-set hardware/ pricing tier. If you instead create an endpoint from a custom model, you can choose between the three tiers.

When you’re about to run out your free credits, we will prompt you to put down your credit card, which you can do in your [Account Usage page](https://octoai.cloud/usage). If there is a card in the system already, we will automatically charge your card for the auto-reload amount.

* You can always check how many credits you have remaining in the top-level banner in the UI (see screenshot below).
* If you do not put down a valid credit card before your credits run out, we will suspend your account and automatically terminate all your endpoints.

You can view your usage to date, add a credit card, and view invoices in your [Account Usage page](https://octoai.cloud/usage) anytime.
