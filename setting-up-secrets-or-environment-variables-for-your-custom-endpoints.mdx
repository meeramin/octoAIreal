title: "Setting up account-wide secrets for your custom endpoints"
---

When creating a new endpoint from your custom containers, you may wish to mount your account-wide secrets onto your container, such as database secrets. Simply click the "Select secret(s)" dropdown when creating a new endpoint, and then the + sign next to "New Secret."

That would bring up a modal in which you can specify a key and a value for the secret. For example, if you create secret with key `foo` whose value is `bar,` you will get a variable `foo` whose value is `bar` mounted to the container.
