## Overview

To make it easier for you to build apps using OctoAI's LLM endpoints, we built end-to-end examples on GitHub [here](https://github.com/octoml/hackathon-2023-rag/tree/main/web-retreiver) and [here](https://github.com/octoml/hackathon-2023-rag/tree/main/pdf-qa) that you can clone and edit. 

* The example apps use 🦜️🔗langchain, 🦙llama\_index, and an OctoAI-hosted LLM endpoint to implement [(1) ](/docs/setup-steps-for-the-qa-app)a generic chatbot and an interface that answers questions about a specific PDF document, and [(2)](/docs/building-a-moviebot-chat-app) a side-by-side chatbot that shows responses from two OctoAI endpoint models using augmented retrieval from OctoAI Documentation and Kubernetes Documentation.
