### OctoAI TypeScript SDK at a glance

If you need assistance with any specifics for using the OctoAI TypeScript SDK, please see the [TypeScript SDK Reference](/docs/typescript-sdk-reference).

The OctoAI TypeScript SDK is intended to help you use OctoAI endpoints. At its simplest, it allows you to run inferences against an endpoint by providing a dictionary with the necessary inputs.

```TypeScript TypeScript
import { Client } from "@octoai/client";

// Token can be provided to the client here.
const client = new Client();

// The endpoint URL can be provided, as well as the inputs necessary to run an inference.
const result = await client.infer("yourEndpointUrl", {"key": "value"});

// It also allows for inference streams for LLMs
const stream = await client.inferStream("yourEndpointUrl", {"key": "value"});

// And for server-side asynchronous inferences
const future = await client.inferAsync("yourEndpointUrl", {"key": "value"});
let ready = await client.isFutureReady(future);
  while (!ready) {
    ready = await client.isFutureReady(future);
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  }
  const outputs = (await client.getFutureResult(future));

// And includes healthChecks
if (await client.healthCheck("healthCheckEndpointUrl") === 200) {
	// Run some inferences
}
```
