Keeping our usersâ€™ data private and secure is our priority. OctoML is SOC II Type I compliant. The OctoAI Compute Service does not persist the inputs, outputs, nor intermediate computations of your inferences, except for runtime logs that you choose to expose in your container. The OctoAI Image Generation service logs the inputs for billing and debugging purposes.

For encryption in transit, we ensure that all connections from customer to the OctoAI compute service require TLS, without you having to manage TLS certifications yourself. We also use encryption at rest for any data that we write to disk.
