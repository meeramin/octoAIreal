The CLI can be used for managing assets under the Image Gen Solution, or managing endpoints under the Compute Service.

The Python SDK can be used for running inferences against our Solutions or Compute Service endpoints.

To deploy endpoints for your custom models, you will need both the CLI and Python SDK. 

### Latest CLI Release

You can install the latest CLI using the following commands:

The below script downloads and installs the latest compatible version of the Python SDK as well as the CLI and works for both Mac and Linux systems.

You can also verify the octoai-sdk has successfully installed in your correct environment.



```shell shell
python3 -m pip show octoai-sdk
```

This should provide an output similar to (though likely with different version numbers):

### Uninstall the CLI and Python SDK

Our installation script installs the OctoAI binary to `usr/local/bin`. You can remove it with:



```shell shell
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/octoai
```

You can uninstall the Python SDK using:

```Python Python
python3 -m pip uninstall octoai-sdk
```

If you used another method of installation such as brew, rpm, etc, please follow the directions from those services.
