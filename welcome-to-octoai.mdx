OctoML is on a mission to offer easy access to **efficient compute** and enable users to integrate their choice of AI models into applications. The OctoAI compute service helps you run, tune, and scale AI applications easily:

<Card title="Run" icon="play" iconType="duotone">
    We give you pre-optimized endpoints for popular open source models that you can immediately use to prototype your app for free, as well as a CLI to easily deploy endpoints from your custom models.
</Card>
<Card title="Tune" icon="radio-tuner" iconType="duotone">
    We enable you to fine-tune popular open-source models to build your private data moat (early access -- contact us on Discord for this).
</Card>
<Card title="Scale" icon="signal-bars" iconType="duotone">
 We automatically scale you endpoints anywhere between 0 hardware replicas to as many as you need. We support customers in scaling to 100,000 monthly active users this year and millions of fine-tuned combinations of Stable Diffusion simultaneously.
</Card>

New users get \~$10 worth of free compute credits for signing up; the credits expire within about one month. That is equivalent to 1,000 SDXL default images, 2+ hours of compute on our large tier hardware, 9+ hours of compute on our medium tier hardware, or 27+ hours of compute on our small tier hardware. The credits expire in about one month.

Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/rXTPeRBcG7) to learn about the applications other customers are building, get help, or just tell us what you are excited about!
