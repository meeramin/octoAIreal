title: "Whisper - Speech Recognition SDK Inferences"
description: "Whisper"
---

For examples of the types of outputs to expect, you can visit the [Whisper Demo](https://octoai.cloud/templates/whisper-demo) at [OctoAI](https://octoai.cloud/).

As a next step, Whisper is an excellent candidate for [Asynchronous Inference Using Python SDK](/docs/asynchronous-inference).

#### Requirements

Please follow [How to create an OctoAI API token](/docs/how-to-create-an-octoai-access-token) if you don't have one already.

#### Whisper: Speech Recognition

Whisper is a natural language processing model that converts audio to text. Like with Stable Diffusion, we’ll use the base64 library for encoding an mp3 or a wav file into a base64 string. For more information on all the ways you can customize your Whisper inferences, please see the [Whisper OpenAPI documentation](https://whisper-demo-kk0powt97tmb.octoai.cloud/docs#/default/%5Fhandle%5Fpredict%5Fpredict%5Fpost).

```Python Python
from octoai.client import Client
import base64

whisper_url = "https://whisper-demo-kk0powt97tmb.octoai.run/predict"
whisper_health_check = "https://whisper-demo-kk0powt97tmb.octoai.run/healthcheck"

# First, we need to convert an audio file to base64.
file_path = "she_sells_seashells_by_the_sea_shore.wav"
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
    encoded_audio = base64.b64encode(f.read())
    base64_string = encoded_audio.decode("utf-8")

# These are the inputs we will send to the endpoint, including the audio base64 string.
inputs = {
    "language": "en",
    "task": "transcribe",
    "audio": base64_string,
}

OCTOAI_TOKEN = "API Token goes here from guide on creating OctoAI API token"
# The client will also identify if OCTOAI_TOKEN is set as an environment variable
# So if you have it set, you can simply use:
# client = Client()
client = Client(token=OCTOAI_TOKEN)
if client.health_check(whisper_health_check) == 200:
  outputs = client.infer(endpoint_url=whisper_url, inputs=inputs)
  transcription = outputs["transcription"]
  assert "She sells seashells by the seashore" in transcription
  assert (
        "She sells seashells by the seashore"
        in outputs["response"]["segments"][0]["text"]
    )
```

With this particular test file, we will have “She sells seashells by the sea shore.” printed in our command line.

#### Whisper Outputs

The above `outputs` variable returns JSON in something like the following format.

```json
{
  prediction_time_ms: 626.42526,
  response: {
    segments: [ [Object] ],
    word_segments: [
      [Object]
    ]
  },
  transcription: ' She sells seashells by the seashore.'
}

```

Each `segment` is an object that looks something like:

```json
{
  start: 5.553,
  end: 8.66,
  text: ' She sells seashells by the seashore.',
  words: [
    {
      word: 'She',
      start: 5.553,
      end: 5.633,
      score: 0.945,
      speaker: null
    },
    {
      word: 'sells',
      start: 5.653,
      end: 5.814,
      score: 0.328,
      speaker: null
    },
    // etc...
  ],
  speaker: null
}

```

Each `word_segment` is an object that looks something like:

```
{ word: 'She', start: 0.010, end: 0.093, score: 0.883, speaker: null }
```
