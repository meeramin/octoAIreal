### Installation Guide

The SDK currently supports Python versions 3.8.1 and upwards. It is strongly recommended that you use a virtual environment such as [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to manage Python packages for your development environment. This helps prevent incompatible dependencies with packages installed irrelevant to your current project or that conflict with system dependencies.

You can view our full release history on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/octoai-sdk/#history) for the latest version of the Python SDK.

For Mac and Linux, use pip to install the octoai-sdk. Python package. We strongly recommend that you install OctoAI in a virtualenv, to avoid conflicting with your system packages.

```shell shell
python3 -m pip install octoai-sdk
```

Please refer to [CLI & SDK Installation](/docs/installation-links) for how to install the SDK in conjunction with the CLI for the authoring tool.

### Setting API token as an environment variable:

In order to access endpoints from OctoAI, an API token needs to be set, for more information on how to generate an access token see [How to Create an OctoAI Access Token](/docs/how-to-create-an-octoai-access-token).

Wherever you set your environment variables for example in your `.bashrc` or `.env` file set `OCTOAI_TOKEN` to the value from the web.

```bash bash
export OCTOAI_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Then when you instantiate the client, it will detect the `OCTOAI_TOKEN` as an envvar and set it for you.

```Python Python
from octoai.client import Client

client = Client()
```

Alternatively, on creation of the [Client](https://octoml.github.io/octoai-python-sdk/octoai.html#octoai.client.Client) class, you can set your token, or the Client also accepts a path to where you've stored your API token from the `config_path` variable. Please see the [Client](https://octoml.github.io/octoai-python-sdk/octoai.html#octoai.client.Client) docs for more information.

```Python Python
from octoai.client import Client

client = Client(token=YOUR_OCTOAI_API_TOKEN_HERE)
```
