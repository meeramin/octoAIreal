All endpoints are by default private. That means you will need an access token in order to run inferences against those endpoints. To generate a token, head to your Account [Settings](https://octoai.cloud/settings).

After generating a token, make sure to store it in your terminal and/or environment file for your app.

```bash bash
export OCTOAI_TOKEN=<INSERT_HERE>
```

Now you'll be able to run inferences against private endpoints! For example:

```bash bash
curl -X POST '<your-endpoint-url>' --data '{"prompt": "What state is Los Angeles in?", "max_length": 100}' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCTOAI_TOKEN"
```
