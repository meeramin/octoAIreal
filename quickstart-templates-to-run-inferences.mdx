### Overview

The Python SDK allows for running inferences against all OctoAI endpoints.

#### Requirements to run inferences

Ensure you have set `OCTOAI_TOKEN` either as an environment variable or passed to the client before getting started. See [Python SDK Installation & Setup](/docs/python-sdk-installation-setup) for more information.

To run an inference, you need to know 2 pieces of data.

1. The endpoint that can accept inferences
2. The data the endpoint takes in to produce an output.

To find this for Example Models, visit [octoai.cloud](https://octoai.cloud/), click on "[Example models](https://octoai.cloud/templates)" and select which one you'd like to use. Let's check this using a Stable Diffusion controlling model called [Canny](https://octoai.cloud/templates/controlnet-canny-demo).

If you scroll down below the GUI to run inferences, you will see "Endpoint URL" as well as a description on how to run an inference using cURL. In the future, examples using the Python SDK will also be available to run more easily.

For health checks, most end with the URL `/healthcheck`
